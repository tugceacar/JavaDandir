 TYPES OF VARIABLES (Fields):
 In Java, there are three types of variables:
 Local Variables
 Instance Variables
 Static Variables
 1) Local Variables:
 Local Variables are a variable that are declared inside the body of a method.
 2) Instance Variables (Non-Static Field):
 Instance variables are defined without the STATIC keyword .
 They are defined Outside a method declaration. They are Object specific and are known as instance variables.
 3) Static Variables:
 Static variables are initialized only once, at the start of the program execution.
 These variables should be initialized first, before the initialization of any instance variables.
 Example: Types of Variables in Java
 public class Girigiri {
 static int a = 1; //static variable
 int data = 99; //instance variable
 void method() {
 int b = 90; //local variable
 }
 }
 4) Global Variables:
 Global variables are the variables that can be accessed anywhere in the java program.
 Java being a strictly object-oriented programming language doesn't have the concept of a global variable.
 But by using static, public and final keywords, a variable can have all the functionality of a global variable.
 Global Variable; There is no direct concept of global variable in java, but you implement the same in different number of ways.
 A)  With the help of static keyword and public access modifier.
 public class GlobalVariable {
 public static int MAX_SIZE = 1000;
 public static int MIN_SIZE = 1;
 public static final String DENVER = "DENVER";
 }
 Now you can access MAX_SIZE and MIN_SIZE from anywhere by calling like this
 globalVariable.MAX_SIZE
 globalVariable.MIN_SIZE
 B) With the help of interface
 public interface GlobalVariable1 {
 // Variable are implicitly public, static, and final
 int MAX_SIZE = 1000;
 int MIN_SIZE = 1;
 }
 Any class that needs to use these, can implement the interface.
 public class GlobalVariable1Demo implements GlobalVariable1{
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 System.out.println("Max Size :"+MAX_SIZE);
 System.out.println("Max Size :"+MIN_SIZE);
 }
 }
 The static modifier, in combination with the final modifier, is also used to define constants. The final modifier indicates that the value of this field cannot change.
